#My Portfolio Website

https://henriquenegrao.pages.dev/

## Introduction

This is a web application built with React and:

- ThreeJS - a powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model
- React Three Fiber - a popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React
- TailwindCSS - a popular utility-first CSS styling framework
- Framer Motion - the most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations

The code is reusable and scalable using Higher Order Components (HOCs) and other industry-standard best practices.

Responsiveness is ensured across all devices and the website's performance is improved by using Suspense and Preload.
